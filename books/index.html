        <h1>Book Corner</h1>
        <p>A collection of interesting books I read in the form of their notable quotes.</p>
        <p>It is not important how many books you read, but which ones - this is a simplification of a Seneca quote:
            <br>
            <i>"You must linger among a limited number of master-thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive
            ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind."</i>
            <br>
            — Seneca, <i>Letters to Lucilius</i> (Letter 2)
        </p>
        <p>

                "Books are not made to be believed, but to be subjected to inquiry. When we consider a book, we mustn't ask ourselves what it says but what it means."

                This quote perfectly captures the essence of critical reading. It's not about accepting everything at face value, but about engaging with the text and understanding its deeper meanings. The book itself is a masterpiece of historical fiction that combines a murder mystery with deep philosophical and theological discussions.
